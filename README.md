# MAKUTU-BIP

*Training on Bayesian Inverse Problems.*

The objective of this course is to introduce and develop Bayesian approaches for solving statistical inverse problems. 

The prerequisites are:

- probability and measure theory,
- partial differential equations,
- statistical simulation (using python).

All the above will be presented at the start of the course, making it accessible to anyone with reasonable undegraduate training. The course will consist of lectures (mornings) and practical sessions (afternoons). The practical sessions will cover theoretical examples and coding exercises in python. All necessary environments and tools will be explained.
